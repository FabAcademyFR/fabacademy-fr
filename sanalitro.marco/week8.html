              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Make something big</h2></div>
            <p class="lead">For this assignment, each one of us had one OSB (Oriented Strand Board) to fabricate something big with the CNC Milling Machine. I decided to study Theo Jansen's leg mechanism and built my version (I wanted to create an addtional motion option for my final project robot). I was very lucky because surfing on internet I found many mathematical and structural references, there are a lot video tutorial and interviews. I chose to simplify the structure and focus my attention on the joints and the mechanism.</p>
            <p class="lead">The OSB size were 2100x1100x19 mm so I had to think something big but not too much. Initially the idea was to make the  complete structure with 3 pairs of legs but I realized just 1 pair because that the pieces needed to obtain the desired object were too big compared to the material that I had available.</p>
            
                <div class="text-muted">
                  <h3>Study of the model and design of the pieces</h3></div>
            
            <p class="lead">To start I studied the work of Theo Jansen ( Dutch artist, researcher of art and physics, famous for his kinetic sculptures) and I designed and built a small prototype in cardboard.</p>
            <p class="lead"><iframe width="540" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b694exl_oZo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
            <p class="lead"><iframe width="540" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NM4q-f68TlY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
           <p class="lead"> It took me a long time to study the joints that enabled me to build my "something big": the problem was not in the rotating joints, but in the right joint between the rotating elements; each leg must moved freely without obstructing the other leg for this reason I had to think the object in horizontal layer by layer and the joints dimention was calibrated on the thickness of the material. In this way, however, the structure becomes unstable. </p>
            <p class="lead">To solve this problem I did a search on the Internet of the locking systems and strengthening and I found some great ideas that you can incorporate into my system.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">Essential for the simultaneous operation of the mechanism is the precision of drawing and cutting. 4 types of joints have to work simultaneously and 2 types of interlocking must ensure the rigidity of the elements.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">Only after cutting I realized that he had made a mistake with the design of two pieces. I had to redesign and mill again the wrong pieces. Fortunately I was able to fix it easily.</p>
            
<div class="text-muted"><h3>cnc cutting pieces</h3></div>

<p class="lead">I took the following steps to cut the pieces:</p>

<p class="lead">- Import the DXF file in the Artcam software and I prepare it in order to have 2 layers (outsided pieces and holes to screwing the board to keep the table attached to the board while the machine is cutting).</p>
<p class="lead">Parameters and Settings:</p>
<p class="lead">- feed rate: 76 mm/s;</p>
<p class="lead">- plunge: 50 mm/s;</p>
<p class="lead">- spindle: 15000 rpm;</p>

<p class="lead">- Put the board in the machine's platform making sure that the surface is clean and smooth.</p>

<p class="lead">- Mounting the end milling tool (6 mm) and set the machine ready. Find x,y and z.</p>

<p class="lead">- Before start the machine rember to open air compressor.</p>

<p class="lead">- Send the file to mark the holes.</p>

<p class="lead">- Drill the screws on the board to fix it and make sure it doesn't move during the process.</p>

<p class="lead">- Sent the file and wait for it to finish cutting. My file took more or less 1 hour to finish.</p>

<p class="lead">- Remove the tabs using a chisel and a hammer.</p>

<p class="lead">- Remove the pieces and the board.</p>

<p class="lead">- Clean all from sawdust.</p>


<div class="text-muted"><h3>PROBLEM FIXED OF MODEL</h3></div>

<p class="lead">I built the model easily using press-fit system (no glue), but I found two problems: I have designed a wrong piece ( I did it linear but to run it need to be curved or have a different dimension) and a joint blocking the rotation. For this reason I re-designed the wrong piece changing its size and I changed the position of the joints to allow the rotation.</p>


<p class="lead">I replaced the pieces and the model is now operational.</p>
