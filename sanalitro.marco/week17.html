              <h3>Assignment purpose</h3></div>
            <p class="lead">The main goal for this week was to define a dissemination plan for our project.</p>
              
              
              <div class="text-muted"> 
              <h3>INVENTION</h3></div>
            <p class="lead">The project has to be "Open Source". I will present my work at the Maker Faire of Rome 2015 and other social events locally. </p>
            <p class="lead">But I don't want to stop here, I contacted my dear Spanish friends who would like to expose the robot to Madrid and Barcelona. Roll-e is a telepresence robot system. If I have the chance to have two or three away from each I can demonstrate their functionality. I also want to propose a collaboration with a group of makers who are doing the "Workshops Make Your Toys".</p>
            <p class="lead">I want to present to the market a product that can be a toy, but that equipped properly can become a tool for work, research and education. I see it as an instrument that can be implemented according to the need of designers and users.</p>
            
                

<div class="text-muted"> 
              <h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3></div>
            <p class="lead">The project is Open Source Hardware and Software. What does it mean? Open Source is more and more an important way to share not only your ideas but also to receive feedback and implementation by the others. By sharing the Roll.e I'm going to reach a bigger community that we’ll be hopefully involved with the upgrade of our product as well. Probably I could use the Creative Common license. “A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwisecopyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work, so they don’t have to worry about copyright infringement, as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.” Looking in the assignments of last 2 year relative to this topic I found also a good reference in the MIT license. They make an interesting point: “the software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.”</p>
            


<div class="text-muted"> 
              <h3>INCOME</h3></div>
            <p class="lead">Roll-e is a telepresence robot system. It can be equipped with a smartphone, small tablet or FPV system (FIRST PERSON VIEW). Controllable remotely it was designed for business, educational, but also fun.</p>
            <p class="lead">I believe that the product is very desirable for the market, but we must reduce production costs and dimensions. I know that building a system on a single product would not work, for this reason I think it would be interesting to collaborate with other firms or project (drones, models for diving).</p>


<p class="lead">The economical strategy can be the following. Keep software and hardware open source, so no income will come from those ones. We can from the other side sell an already made product in case people don’t want to do it by itself. We can also charge for advanced components (hardware / software) that can be implemented in the Robot. If I can involve other projects the system would have a good chance to work.</p>
