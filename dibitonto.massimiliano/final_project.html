								<h3>Intro </h3>
							</header>
							
						  <p>The concept for the final projects stars from my interest about human- computer interaction and novel interaction paradigms. I think technology should make things easier, through automation and amplification of human capabilities. However the interaction with tools should be also fun and pleasurable. As human brain is used to consider “alive” everything that shows a “smart” behaviour (and digital tools usually pretend to be smart) I wanted to create an object that has personality and allows a different kind of human-computer interaction.</p>
					
						<header>
								<h3>The Concept</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The concept is to create a "social robot" that can create an “emotional” interaction with the user and that is able to move him/her to do something. I focused on a specific context of use: pool in a garden during summer. My social robot is a duck that is happy when people are in the pool having fun and that feels lonely when is left alone. So, communicating thorugh social networks, it is able to share its feelings.
                            
</p>
						<header>
								<h3>Background</h3>
							</header>
							<p>There are several projects aimed to control water quality in pools or aquariums. Almost all projects control temperature and pH/oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as it’s very expensive (and difficult) to control other chemical parameters. However all projects are just measurement tools and the interaction it's just based on a functional goal:

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/phduino/">pHDuino</a>,
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-Your-Own-Spa-or-Pool-Monitor/">Pool monitor</a>,
<a href="http://openspamonitor.blogspot.it/">OpenSPA Monitor</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Scott216/Poolduino">PoolDuino</a>.</p>
<p>
Regarding giving a personality to the objects my inspiration is the work of simone Rebaudengo with his "addicted products" project. Here there is the video of Brad "the toaster". </p></br><p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/41363473" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/41363473">Addicted products: The story of Brad the Toaster</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/fishandchipsing">Simone Rebaudengo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
					<p> Brad shows a personality, it feels lonely when nobody uses it, require attention and so on. It communicates through tweets and movements.</p>
                    <p>Another example of social robot/digital companion is Jibo (watch the video below)</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3N1Q8oFpX1Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                    
                    <p>
                    From a theoretical point of view my project took inspiration from Affective Computing (for a definition <a href=“http://affect.media.mit.edu/“>MIT Media Lab page</a>, a good overview  is given by the <a href=“https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/affective_computing.html”> Interaction Design Foundation </a> and, of course, there is the book of Don Norman <a href=“http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Love-Everyday-Things/dp/0465051367”>Emotional Design</a>) and from gmaification and <a href=“http://www.thefuntheory.com/“>the Fun Theory</a> .
                    </p>
                    
						<header>
								<h3>Scenario</h3>
							</header>
							<p>It is a hot summer evening. The duck is in the pool, alone. Everybody is at work. The duck is feeling alone and starts sending pictures on Twitter/Facebook to invite people to come in. In the meantime the duck checks the temperature and the pH of the water, adding chlorine if needed, so the pool will be ready when people will arrive. 
							Later Max comes back with some friends and they enter into the pool, the duck feels the presence of other people and is happy. It shares a status on Twitter/Facebook. Other ducks in the network read the status...   </p>
							
					<header>
								<h3>Main Functionalities</h3>
							</header>	
		<p>	After the first concept I pointed out the main functionalities of the duck.
		<ul class="default" >
		<li>Tweet some status according to some rules applied to the parameters monitored showing a personality: require attention when nobody is in the pool for a long time, be happy when there are people around, be happy when the water is at a good temperature to swim;</li>
		<li>Send an help request if someone tries to sink it.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The duck should have this capabilities:
        
        <ul class="default">
		<li>Check the temperature of the water</li>
		<li>Check the air temperature</li>
		<li>Know if is day, night, sunny or cloudy (light detection + Yahoo Weather API)</li>
		<li>Detect waves as sign of human activity (people in the pool)</li>
        <li>Detect if someone tries to sink it<li>Connect to the Internet to access information and share data</li>
		
		</ul>
		<p>And should have these basic electronic components:
		<ul class="default">
		<li>Temperature sensors</li>
		<li>Light sensor</li>
		<li>Accelerometer (to feel the waves)</li>
		<li>Wireless connection to the Internet</li>
		<li>Electronics to make everything work!</li>
		</ul></p>

								<h3>Challenges</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I think that the main challenges to develop the project will be:
							<ul class="default">
							<li>Water and electronics! : choose the right materials to make the structure and protect the electronics from the water and corrosion.</li>
							<li>Power consumption: it should optimize the use of power and recharge with solar panels</li>
							</ul></p>

								<h3>Development</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this section I will update the current progress of the project development according to the activities reported in the <a href="15-application.html">applications and implications assignment</a>.
          </p>
          <div class="progress">
    <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="40" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width:30%">
      30% Complete
    </div>
  </div>

          
     <h4>Design an make the case (the duck)</h4>    
     <p>I'm building first the electronic part to correctly size the duck to host it. A preview of the model could be seen <a href="http://a360.co/1DX8Voa">here</a> and below. </p><p><iframe src="https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue298cd1c1/shares/public/SH7f1edQT22b515c761e8a1a6eee4835897f" width="90%" height="400"></iframe>
     </p>
      <h4>Design the board and put pieces together</h4>
      <p>I'm trying to reduce the size of the Fabkit removing the pin I'm not using. I've already ordered some of the material needed. <p>
      <h4>Making the code</h4>
      <p>As I still don't have all the electronics I'm reasoning on the behaviour and how to translate it into code.Some of the behavior I want to implement:</p>
      <ul class="default">
      <li>if the duck doesn't feel presence in the water for a couple of hours and is daytime (NTP) post on Twitter some random sentence to say it feels lonely. If the weather is good (Yahoo Weather API) and the water is warm invites people to bath.</li>
      <li>In the morning it wishes a good morning to everybody on Twitter</li>
      <li>At the dawns it wishes a good night to everybody on Twitter</li>
      <li>If someone try to sink it send an help request on Twitter</li>
      <li>If t it feels presence of people(accelerometers) sends happy statuses on Twitter</li>
      <li>If is bad weather (Yahoo Weather API) is sad and sends sad statuses on Twitter</li>
      </ul>
