								<h3>Intro  </h3>
							</header><p>This collects answers to some key questions about my final project. All the documentation about the final project could be found in the  <a href="final_project.html">final project page</a>. </p>
							<header>
								<h3>What tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain?  </h3>
							</header>
                            <p>In the <a href="final_project.html">final project page</a> I'm keeping track of the completion of the tasks subdivided in 3 areas: making the case, making the electronics and programming. Each area has a progress bar that indicates the percentage of tasks done and you can find the description of all the problems and the troubleshooting.
                            All the tasks were completed.</p>

								<h3>what has worked? what hasn't?</h3></header>
                                <p> My biggest problem was with the case (the body of the duck). It is big and required many hours of print. To reduce the hours I reduced also the quality of the print but then it was not water resistant. So I had to test different settings (as described in the <a href="final_project.html">final project page</a>) and I used also epoxic resin. However this is one thing I have to work more studying also the hydrodynamic and maybe I'll add a keel to make it more stable.</p><p> The electronics worked fine and also the code. The only problem is that sometimes there is a timeout while downloading data from the web but this is not very significant as the info could be downloaded later.</p>

								<h3>what questions need to be resolved?</h3>
                                </header>
                                <p>During the development of the project I have to solve different questions.The biggest problem is to make electronics safety work in a wet environment. Indeed the duck is meant to stay in a pool. Problems are related to insulation but also to interferences in the Wi-Fi communication as water can influence radio waves at 2.4 GHz. Another problem is related to power management. Electronics and code should be optimized to harvest energy to allow a longer duration of the battery. The most expensive part in terms of energy consumption is related to wireless communication. </p>

								<h3> what will happen when?</h3>
                                </header>
                                <p>I decide to keep the project simple in order to realize a first prototype and test and refine my idea. Beginning with too many functionalities could be dangerous for a correct project development. Moreover I learn a lot of things while making the prototype. The most important one was the problem with the water. Even with a good print I didn't had a waterproof case. I used epoxy resin but it partially solved the problem. So one of the future developments will be to find another way to make the case waterproof.</p>There are a couple of things that I want to develop in the future:</p>
                          <ul class="default">
                          <li> improve the interaction with the user adding more physical feedbacks</li>
                          <li>make a distributed architecture that allows to expand the system adding sensors and actuators (maybe wireless connected)</li>
                          <li>add a ph sensor</li>
                          <li>add a chlorine dispenser</li>
                          <li>add a solar panel for battery recharge</li>
                          </ul>
                          
      <header>
								<h3>what have you learned?</h3>
                                </header><p>I've learned a lot about electonics and especially how to make my own boards instead of using pre-fabricated ones. The main advantage is that i can customize my board just to fit my needs.  So they do only the things I need and can be smaller and cheaper than the pre fabricated ones. Moreover I learned how to make complex programs in Arduino and to program other microcontrollers. I learned a lot also about 3D modelling, I used different softwares and followed a lot of tutorials and for sure I'll continue studying it. 
                                I learned how to use SVN and a better way to manage projects.I learned that I can make almost everything :)</p>

								<h3>documentation during development</h3></header><p>
                               I documented all the steps during the development in the  <a href="final_project.html">final project page</a>. </p>
