								<h3>Intro </h3>
							</header>
							<p> The assignment of the first week was to create a personal presentation and a proposal for the final project, but also (to accomplish to these tasks) to get familiar with some technologies, as HTML5 and CSS3 (to design a website) and version control systems. I'm already familiar with HTML5 and CSS3 (even if I'm not a master!), so to design the website I started from a template and I customized it. I used Sublime Text and Text Wrangler (I'm working on two macs with different applications). I was less familiar with CVS (used to download but not to upload) so I went through some tutorials using Git to better understand the conceps of Head, Staging, Commit, Push and Pull. I found <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">this documentation</a> very useful.
							<p>To think to something for my final project I started form my ideas about human- computer interaction. I think technology should make things easier, through automation and amplification of human capabilities. However the interaction with tools should be also fun and pleasurable. As human brain is used to consider “alive” everything that shows a “smart” behaviour (and digital tools usually pretend to be smart) I wanted to create an object that has personality and allows a different kind of human-computer interaction.</p>
					
						<header>
								<h3>Final Project Concept</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The concept is to create a robot to help in the maintenance of a pool showing also a personality (i.e. posting things on Twitter) to the user, with the aim to create an “emotional” interaction with the user.
</p>
						<header>
								<h3>Background</h3>
							</header>
							<p>There are several projects aimed to control water quality in pools or aquariums. Almost all projects control temperature and pH/oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as it’s very expensive (and difficult) to control other chemical parameters. However all projects are just measurement tools and the interaction it's just based on a functional goal:
<a href=" https://www.sparkyswidgets.com/portfolio-item/ph-probe-interface/">Ph-Probe</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/phduino/">pHDuino</a>,
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-Your-Own-Spa-or-Pool-Monitor/">Pool monitor</a>,
<a href="http://openspamonitor.blogspot.it/">OpenSPA Monitor</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Scott216/Poolduino">PoolDuino</a>.</p>
<p>
Regarding giving a personality to the objects my inspiration is the work of simone Rebaudengo with his "addicted products" project. Here there is the video of Brad "the toaster". </p></br>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/41363473" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/41363473">Addicted products: The story of Brad the Toaster</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/fishandchipsing">Simone Rebaudengo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.
					<p> Brad shows a personality, it feels lonely when nobody uses it, require attention and so on. It communicates through tweets and movements.</p>
						<header>
								<h3>Scenario</h3>
							</header>
							<p>It is a hot summer evening. The duck is in the pool, alone. Everybody is at work. The duck is feeling alone and starts sending pictures on Twitter/Facebook to invite people to come in. In the meantime the duck checks the temperature and the pH of the water, adding chlorine if needed, so the pool will be ready when people will arrive. 
							Later Max comes back with some friends and they enter into the pool, the duck feels the presence of other people and is happy. It shares a status on Twitter/Facebook. Other ducks in the network read the status...   </p>
							
					<header>
								<h3>Main Functionalities</h3>
							</header>	
		<p>	Even if the project is still at the beginning I try to imagine the main functionalities that I can include in the project.
		<ul class="default" >
		<li>Check the pH of the pool</li>
		<li>Check other chemical parameters (research needed)</li>
		<li>Release chlorine if needed (or with some external device)</li>
		<li>Check the temperature</li>
		<li>Know if is day or night (light detection)</li>
		<li>Tweet some status according to some rules applied to the parameters monitored</li>
		<li>Detect waves as sign of human activity (people in the pool)</li>
		<li>Show a personality: require attention when nobody is in the pool for a long time, be happy when there are people around, be happy when the water is in good condition</li>
		<li>Swim</li>
		<li>Take picture and upload to the web</li>
		
		</ul>
		<p>To accomplish to these functionalities the system should have:
		<ul class="default">
		<li>pH probe</li>
		<li>Light sensor</li>
		<li>Accelerometer (to feel the waves)</li>
		<li>Can connect to Internet (WiFi) and post on Twitter/Facebook</li>
		<li>Electronics to make everything work!</li>
		</ul></p>

								<h3>Challenges</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I think that the main challenges to develop the project will be:
							<ul class="default">
							<li>Water and electronics! : choose the right materials to make the structure and protect the electronics from the water and corrosion.</li>
							<li>Power consumption: it should optimize the use of power and recharge with solar panels</li>
							</ul></p>
					
					
					
					
					<header>
								<h3>Development</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The steps to develop the projects will be:
							<ul class="default">
							<li>Defines the main features and functionalities</li>
							<li>Define the shape and choose the materials</li>
							<li>Design the electronics</li>
							<li>Write the code</li>
							<li>High fidelity prototype</li>
							<Testing</li>
							</ul></p>
