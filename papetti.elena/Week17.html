        <h4 strong="lead"> This week the assignment was about invention, intellectual property and income. The idea behind this exercise was to develop a plan for dissemination of your final project. Basically how do you perceive this project. What are you going to do with this project? Are you developing it further? Is it going to be an open source or open hardware or both?</strong></h4>

        <h3 strong="lead">INVENTION: </strong> </h3>    
<p class="lead">  E_Motion is a project about Wearable Computing. A blaze that plays sounds through the user's movement. Interiorly, the dress will be provided with an electronic circuit controlled by a Fabkit (a PCB produced by me). A flex sensors suited in the blaze  sends the signal via Bluetooth to a computer that translates it into a sound output. The project comes from the idea I have to make a little show of performative art in the future. New technologies have radically changed the society and with it the art world. In the performing arts we can see a great development about the Interaction between the body and mechanical or informatic systems. Through an Interface it's possible obtain, for example, sound or light effects directly connected to the body. My project is placed exactly in this sphere of Interaction Design. Built a first prototype it will possible works on the project and develops different solutions of it, both aesthetic and sound effects. For the future I would like to collaborate locally and glocally with artists to develop art projects. My idea is to make open source the code and the methods used to make the mechanical part of the blaze.</p> 

 <h3 strong="lead">INTELLETTUAL PROPERTY: </strong> </h3>    
<p class="lead"> The idea behind this project and its further development after Fab Academy is mostly social and academic. Social because it will be open source and there will be a community of people contributing and improving it. Academic because it will help students to understand the concepts of it. I've been studying  and investigating about digital fabrication and I've been working and developing my projects applying tools and knowledge available.<br> 
Those tools were a fundamental part of comprehending, and in a forthcoming time, guide those who seek the same kind of acquaitance. I consider my final project and most of the assignments that I developed under this perspective, as also a tool for those whom intent to learn more about those new technologies.  <br> 
Thereby, my final project and all files available in this website are meant to be part of learning process for future makers generations and will be used under the agreement:  <br> <br/>

    <h3 strong="lead">INCOME: </strong> </h3>    
<p class="lead">The idea of the income doesnâ€™t make sense here, in my case as i am making the software open source, so that everyone will be able to download the code for free and make or modify their own units locally. Basically the software is accessible for everyone, and then sell the support services. As i said, the project has an open source software, there will be no income coming from it. As this project still at the basic level makes no sens speaks about gain.</p>
