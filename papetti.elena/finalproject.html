                <h2 class="featurette-heading">plays sounds by body movements</h2>
            </div><br>

<p class="lead">E_Motion<sup>1.0</sup> is a Blazer with a removable electronic circuit, in its inner part, consisting of 4 Flex Sensors placed along the sleeves of the blazer, up to the shoulders and the elbows. This Sensors generate sounds making movements with arms like raising a shoulder or bending an elbow.<br> 
 The project is made taking care about three important aspects: Mechanical, Electronics, Programming.<br><br/>  
MECHANICAL: <br> 
E_Motion<sup>1.0</sup> is made of a three layers fabric according to a sandwich stratification. The two outers layers, which form the coating, are of a thin NON WOVEN FABRIC which locally in Italy calls "telina sotto palma" and the layer in the middle is of a Hypoallergenic Polyester with a thickness about 3 mm for a total of about 5 mm. I wanted this thickness to give to the design a solid structure. I thought about it as 3D object so I used the Polyester fabric to make outer 5 cm wide bands on the blaze.   <br> <br/> 
ELECTRONICS:<br> 
The electronics circuit consisting of several components.<br>  
-The Fabkit by myself produced, which is the main board, with an Atmega328p as microcontroller.<br>  
-An Input Shield, always produced by myself, to connect the sensor to the Board.<br> 
-A commercial Bluetooth Device to send data from the Board to PC. <br>  
-A 5V Battery assembled by myself for the power of the circuit.<br>  
-4 Flex Sensors connected by wires to the Input Shield.<br> 
All the circuit, except flex sensor are inserted in a protective case that I had designed and printed in the Fab Lab. The case and the sensor with wires are inserted trough slots in the interior of the blaze. <br> <br/> 
PROGRAMMING:<br>
This is the heart of E_Motion<sup>1.0</sup>. It works thanx input and output codes required to complete the project as a basic prototype.<br>
Flex Sensors are setted on a sketch I wrote with Arduino Ide. The data collected by the microcontroller are sent via Bluetooth to PC. To translate this data in a sound output I need a second sketch which I  wrote with Processing using the Beads Library. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">THE CONCEPT:<span class="text-muted"></h2>
             <p class="lead">At the beginning of Fab Academy my <a href="week1.html" >project proposal</a> was always about wearable and my idea was to study the right posture during fitness or physical activities. With my background as an Architect and doing some researches I quickly realized to reach that goal I should begin by one step easier. So I decided to focus on still body movement but work on a simple study of input &amp; output to work in the sphere of performing arts.<br><br/> 
             E_Motion<sup>1.0</sup> is the brainchild to study the body movement related to an output like light, vibration or sound. I decided to made this latter taking <a href="http://fabtextiles.org/colaboracion-close-to-the-body-i/ this and this projects as references.">this</a> and <a href="http://gerard.tv/198118/3954476/gallery/the-wearable-fashion-orchestra">this</a> projects as references.
             </p> <p class="lead"> So E_Motion<sup>1.0</sup> is a dress for a performer that plays sounds moving the arms. Having four sensors my idea would be to produce a composition of four different sounds such as drums cymbals. To do that I need to elebarote data with a programming language like PURE DATA passing trough Processing. <br> The removable Electronic Circuit is inserted with a proctetive case inside the blazer.</p>

                      <h2 class="featurette-heading">PROGRESS:<span class="text-muted"></h2>
                      <p class="lead">I started to work really on my project the last 4 weeks of Fab Academy. Knowing that I have much work to do I decided to work managing the time in three weeks:<br>
                      1st: Dress Design and Measuraments, the purchase of all materials and Circuit Design. <br>
                      2nd: Fabric Cutting, Circuit Production and Testing of it, Interface and Sound output. <br>
                      3rd: Tests and Solutions of possible problems.<br>
                      4th: somenthing will go wrong and I'll be still working.<br> <br/>
                      Done the time calendar I wanted subdivide my work into three sections to proceed cleraly. 
                  At the beginning my idea was to realize the project in Neoprene for the thickness(3/5 mm) and the elasticity of the fabric and more to confer a solid 3D structure to my project. I ordered online the product and it should have arrived in the 2nd week of the calendar but there was a shipping error and I deleted it. Here in Frosinone was difficult to looking for Neoprene so after a day of search I decided to find an alternative solution to made my project. I went in a local Matress Factory of and after explained the problem and my needs to realize in few time the project, I asked to proprietor if was possible made a quilt that I would cut in a second moment. The outcome was really succesfull! I obtained for free in one day the seam of a three-layer fabric of size 3x5 m (a quantity for at least 3 projects!). </p>
