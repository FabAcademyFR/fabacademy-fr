  <br></br>
    <p class="lead">During the first week of the Fab Academy we were asked to make a personal webpage and present an idea for our final project.
    </br>
    <br>The first step for me was to get familiar with HTML5 and CSS3. Before that, I had no idea how this stuff works. 
<br>
<br>To design this website, I started from a template <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">startbootstrap.com</a> and I customized it. I used a free editor: Text Wrangler. 
<br>
<br>Then I got in touch with  Github Repository. I had uploaded my website in the Academy Archive via terminal loading with Mac system. I made also a personal repository to host all the files made whithin the FabAcademy assignments.
<br>
</br>  FREE EDITOR: <a href="http://download.cnet.com/TextWrangler/3000-2351_4-10220012.html">TextWrangler.html</a>
</br>  HTML5 TUTORIALS:<a href="http://www.html.it/"> www.html.it</a>;<a href="http://www.3wschools.com/"> www.3wschools.com</a>
</br>  GIT  DOCUMENTATION: <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc "> www.git-scm.com/doc </a>
               </p>
                <p class="lead">To challenge myself in the creation of a website was very interesting. I understood the great work that is needed to realize a simple HTML page, and I have got familiar with a new language. Today, if you're not online you do not exist, so I believe that all this work will be useful for me in the future.</p>
                  </br>  
             
            <div><h3 class="featured-heading">MY FINAL PROJECT AND ME</h3></div>            
            <p class="lead">I decided to begin describing me and my idea for the final project: a responsive facade. I'm an architect, a maker as well as CEO for M3p Industrial marmi. I've worked for 8 years within the construction industry, recently my main interest has shifted towards the connections between smart materials and architecture. I'm the co-founder of FabLab Frosinone – Officine Giardino and the founder of MarbleEcoDesign project. Whit Henka project I won Reshape, digital craft competition.
</br>
</br>I often have to project installations for trade fairs, museums, public spaces and private homes. Having no knowledge of electronics, I have never gone further. I would like to take this opportunity to project a movable wall that responds to external stimulations, such as humidity, light and sounds.
