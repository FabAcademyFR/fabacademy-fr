    <div><h2 class="featured-heading">Applications and Implications about my final project</h2></div>
            
<p class="lead">Assignment: propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered:</p>
 <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/applications_implications/index.html"> applications_implications/index.html</a> 
      <br></br>
    
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHAT WILL IT DO?</h4>  
 <p class="lead">The project I want to develop is an interactive panel. It opens and closes responding to input coming from environmental conditions, creating an artistic and functional effect. 
 	<br>My final project is a modular 50x50cm panel. It can be used in exhibition areas to protect works of art from sunlight. In fact, the elastic tissue that connects the three panels closes it self turning clockwise, and open up turning anticlockwise. It allows to restrict or to increase the light passing through the panel. The engine composed of toothed belts and pulleys creates this mechanism. 
 	      <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHO'S DONE WHAT BEFOREHAND?</h4>    
 <p class="lead">The project is inspired by Pierre Le Roux's works of art. Pierre le Roux is an artist based in Melbourne. He's a design specialised in metal fabrication, manufacturing and installing standout. He makes laser cut metal signs and lettering for clients all across Australia. 
 	 	  <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHAT MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS WILL BE REQUIRED? HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?</h4>  
 <p class="lead">The total cost of a single panel will be approximately € 90, subdivided into:
<br/>Mechanical components
 	<br>- 4 threaded rods 
 	<br>- 24 bolts
 	<br>- Toothed belt 10€ 
 	<br>- 3 plywood panels 50cmx100cm - 20€
 	<br>- Stretch fabric 
 	<br>- 5 pulleys 
 	<br>- 1 Wiper Motor 
 	<br>- 1 Power module
 		</p>
 <p class="lead"> Electronic components:
 	<br>- Fab Kit Miky
 	<br>- 2 Electronic limits 3€
 	<br>- 2 Buttons 4€ 
 	<br>- 1 Phototransistor 3,5€
		</p>
 <p class="lead"> USE MACHINES:
 	<br>- Laser cutting
  	<br>- 3d Printer
   	<br>- Milling Machine
 	   <br>
		</p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHERE WILL THEY COME FROM?</h4> 
  <p class="lead">I'll realize mechanical parts with 3D printer and laser cut. Raw materials such as PLA are produced in Puglia, an Italian region. The plywood comes from a carpenter of Frosinone, pulleys are laser cut, the elastic tissue is produced by a factory in Frosinone. The power module comes from an old 5v-self phone. All electronic components come from online shop, mainly from China.  The wiper motor  comes from the garage of a  friend of mine.  
 	   <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHAT PARTS AND SYSTEMS WILL BE MADE? WHAT PROCESSES WILL BE USED?</h4> 
  <p class="lead">I will produce by myself all electronic shields, davits/hoist, and plywood panels. The electronic shields will be designed and milled with the SRM20. The Davits / hoist will be modeled and 3D printed, pulleys and the panels will be laser cut. 
	 	   <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHAT TASKS NEED TO BE COMPLETED?</h4> 
  <p class="lead">I have made a prototype, to better understand the mechanism of my project. I am waiting for some electronics components to proceed with the realization of the final model. 
	 	   <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHAT QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED?</h4> 
  <p class="lead">- What sensors to use? One of my doubts about this project was the choice of the sensors, because I had a lot of possibilities. I decided to imagine the wall I want to build into a museum, so I decided to use a light sensor, but it is possible add every sensor you need.
 	<br>- Which engine to use? The hypotheses were: a servo motor, a stepper, or a wiper motor. I chose a wiper motor because it makes 360° rounds. 
 	<br>- It will be salable? I chose this project because I already have requests. 
	 	   <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">WHAT IS THE SCHEDULE?</h4> 
  <p class="lead">- 3D modeling components;
 	<br>- Printing components with 3D printer;
 	<br>- After that checking the correct measurements of the joints and consequently laser cutting plywood;
 	<br>- When the components of electronic will come, solder and do the sketch with the Arduino IDE;
 	<br>- Fit all parts and pray that it works.
	 	   <br>
         </p>
<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">HOW WILL IT BE EVALUATED?</h4> 
  <p class="lead">- THE GOAL: One module requires different processes (electronics, programming, 3D designing and modeling, 3D printing, laser-cutting and mechanism designing). My goal for the final presentation is to have one single module assembled and working. When I began the Fab Academy 2015, my skills in electronics and programming were very poor. I guess I still have a lot to learn, but if my wall will work, it means I managed to learn how to incorporate different devices into one single mechanism. To have this module running will show my understanding of electronics programming, and how they can be applied to the fabrication of systems and mechanisms. I consider that it’s a project that puts multiple fabrication processes together in a logical way. Having it working will prove that I am on the way to be able to make (almost) anything.
