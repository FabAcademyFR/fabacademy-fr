<p class="lead">Assignment: Develop a plan for dissemination of your final project
      <br/>
         </p>
<h4 class="featured-heading">Invention</h4>  
 <p class="lead"> My final project, an interactive panel, can be interesting for museums corporations, exhibition and public spaces, but also for individuals. As an architect, I could propose it to my customers. An interactive wall can help saving objects and works of art, but it could also have more applications and answer to different needs.
 <br/>Anyway, the project has to be open source. The programming of the project was aided by open source code, and the project and all its files will be available on different websites, including my Fab Academy website, my personal social network accounts, and “MarbleEcoDesign” project website. 
 	      <br/>
         </p>
<h4 class="featured-heading">Intellectual Property:</h4>    
 <p class="lead"> For my final project, I need a licence that permits people to share knowledge in easy and clear way and let people to continue developing the interactive wall to many goals. So, I decided to choose an Open Source Hardware and Software licensed under MIT license.

<h4 class="featured-heading">Income:</h4>    
 <p class="lead"> The first step is to develop my idea in my FabLab (Officine Giardino – Frosinone). My plan is to continue developing the wall after the course ends. I already met a company interested in my project, and there is the possibility to expose it in one of their exhibition spaces. Moreover, I'd like to evolve my project, putting to good use the results achieved by MarbleEcoDesing. It would be interesting to use recycled marble dust to make the second version of my interactive panel.
