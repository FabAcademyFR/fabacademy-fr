<div><h3 class="featured-heading"> 3D MODEL:</h3></div>
  	<p class="lead">Even for this modeling activity I chose to use Rhinoceros, I did not have much time to experiment with other softwares.
	<br>After drawing 3D model, I exported the file in Stl.
		</p>
	<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/3DMODEL.jpg">
	<p class="lead">P.S.: Make sure it is in the box -x + y axis with the origin point 0.0. Export the model as Stl. 
	 <br> This precaution is not necessary for all the CNC machines, but exclusively for the one present in Fablab Frosinone, because, due to lack of space, the machine was assembled with reversed axes.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lead">After you export the file in Stl, import it with MeshCAM software that will generate the G-code.</p>
<br>		
<p class="lead">The first phase is the construction and the preparation of the mold.
<br> We used a block of polyurethane 60x80x10cm, however we chose to draw a pattern of smaller dimensions (50x70x6), to avoid technical problems later.</p>
<br>
		<p class="lead">Caution:  
		<br>- Do not create negative angles,  you must be able to remove the "piece" from the mold; 
<br>- Do not draw too vertical inside edges: you need to consider the size of the mandrel and its armor. If the surface to be milled is very deep, the angle must be wider.</p>
<br>	
<div><h3 class="featured-heading">ROUGHING:</h3>
	<p class="lead">- MeshCAM will generate the G-code. 
	<br>- endmill = 8 mm
	<br>- feed rate : 1100 
<br>- plunge: 500 
<br>- spindle speed: 12000
<br>- depth per pass: 4 mm
</p>
	<p class="lead">Roughing is a fundamental process, because it removes unnecessary parts from raw material . This operation is used to prepare the material for processing and finishing.

		<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">SMOOTHING:</h4> 
	<p class="lead">After milling, I had to smooth the mold with sandpaper to eliminate remaining impurities.

	</p>
	<br>
		<div><h3 class="featured-heading">PREPARATION MOLD:</h3>
<p class="lead">1) I solidified surface with a mixture (2: 1 ratio) EpoxiResina Part A - Hardener Part B (CATALYST), to prepare the surface to lamination.</p>
	<p class="lead">I had to make two layers, waiting time: 2 hours per layer</p>
	<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/waterproofing.jpg">
	</br>
<p class="lead">2) I coated the releasing wax (Mold Release) 5 times every 30 minutes.</p>
<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/waxing.jpg">
	</br>
	<p class="lead">3) I smeared gelcoat (Gel-hardener 2% by weight) over the mold, twice, without waiting for the first layer was dry.</p>
<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/distaccante.jpg">
	</br>
		<p class="lead">4) I cut 6 layers of the same size: 3 linen fabric, 1 Peel ply, 1 bleeder, 1 felt.</p>
<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/materials.jpg">
	</br>
	 <p class="lead">5) I prepared the resin to be spread over the three layers of linen fabric (300g / sqm ratio). </p>
<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/resining.jpg">
	</br>
	 <p class="lead">6) I placed the resin on the three layers of fabric, then I covered the fabric with Peel ply Bleeder (Perforated plastic red) and Felt.</p>
	 <p class="lead">7) I Put the Mold with all fabric layers in the Vacuum Bag.</p>
</p>
</p>
	</br>
			<h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">UNPACKING:</h4> 
<p class="lead">8) After 4 hours under pressure, and 24h in the Vacuum Bag, I could remove the model from the mold</p>
</p>
<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/unpack.jpg">
	<br></br>
	<p class="lead">9) The mold has not come out at best, for which it was necessary to sandpaper it again.</p>
<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/roughing.jpg">

	<img class="featured-image  img-responsive pull-center" src="img/week12/mold.jpg">

					<p class="lead">The outcome is a decorative panel.</p>
		<p class="lead">I did not like this exercise. There were too many dead times and a lot of waste material.</p>
